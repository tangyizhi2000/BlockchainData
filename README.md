# BlockchainData
Blockchain Project: Discovering NFT Trends with OpenSea Data, IPFS, and Property Analysis.

The project will involve extracting NFT transaction data and metadata from OpenSea, retrieving
NFT images from IPFS, and using data analysis and visualization techniques to identify trends
and patterns based on different properties.

# Milestones:

Week 1 (04/17-04/23): 爬数据, Data Pre-processing

Week 2 (04/24-04/30): Machine Learning etc.

Week 3 (05/01-05/07): Finalize; Report

Data Collection and Storage: (tyz, hhy)
	1. Extracting NFT transaction data and metadata from OpenSea using their API
	2. Retrieving NFT images or videos from IPFS using their content-addressed hashes
	3. Storing the collected data in a suitable database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)

Data Pre-processing: (zxy)
	1. Cleaning and organizing the collected data for analysis
	2. Identifying relevant properties and features for NFT trend analysis (e.g.,categories, design studios, intellectual property holders, sales history).
	3. Extracting and encoding features from the data for further analysis

Data Analysis: (zyt)
	1. Analyzing the data using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms
to identify patterns and trends based on different properties
	2. Investigating correlations and relationships between properties and NFT market
performance
	3. Identifying emerging trends and opportunities in the NFT market

Documentation and Presentation: (一起)
	1. Writing comprehensive documentation detailing the data collection, analysis, and visualization process
	2. Preparing a presentation highlighting key findings and insights from the NFT property-based trend analysis
	3. Sharing the project with the community and gathering feedback for improvement

Deliverables: (一起)
	1. A clean and organized dataset of NFT transaction data, metadata, and associated IPFS image hashes
	2. Insightful analysis on NFTs.

Evaluation:
	1. Completeness and quality of the data collection and preprocessing
	2. Effectiveness of the data analysis techniques in identifying NFT trends and patterns
based on properties
	3. Quality and comprehensiveness of project documentation and presentation
